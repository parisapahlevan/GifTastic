# Emotions GIPHY
Using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs Emotions!
created an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called topics.

I chose Emotions!

created an app That should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

used loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.


Added a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array. Then made a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
